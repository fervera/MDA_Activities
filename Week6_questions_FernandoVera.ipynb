    "### Step 12: Calculate Total Complaints and Complaints per 1,000 Residents\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand how complaint volume compares across ZIP codes, adjusting for population size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "- Count how many 311 complaints were made **per ZIP code**.\n",
    "- Normalize by population to get **complaints per 1,000 residents**. Complaints per 1000 is calculated as: total complaints divided by population, then multiplied by 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How?\n",
    "1. Use `.groupby()` to group data by ZIP.\n",
    "2. Use `.agg()` to compute:\n",
    "   - The total number of complaints using `count` on the `Unique Key`.\n",
    "   - The population using the `first` non-null value from the `population` column.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can pass this as a dictionary with:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   .agg({'column name 1': 'aggregation function 1', 'column name 2': 'aggregation function 2', ...})\n"
