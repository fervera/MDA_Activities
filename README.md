Welcome to MDA Activities 👋

Hi there! 👋
This repository showcases my learning journey through the Master’s in Data Analytics program. Here, you’ll find notebooks, projects, and exercises that reflect my progress in data exploration, visualization and programming.

Feel free to explore, share feedback, or get inspired by some of the activities I’ve worked on along the way. 🚀
